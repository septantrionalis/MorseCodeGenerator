TODAYS WEATHER FORECAST IS CALLING FOR MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WITH A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS IN THE MORNING, FOLLOWED BY INCREASING CLOUD COVER IN THE AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO REACH A HIGH OF 80 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WITH A LIGHT BREEZE COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST.  OVERNIGHT, WE CAN EXPECT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING DOWN TO AROUND 65 DEGREES. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE LATE EVENING, SO ITS A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP AN UMBRELLA HANDY JUST IN CASE.  LOOKING AHEAD TO TOMORROW, WE CAN ANTICIPATE A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING A HIGH OF 75 DEGREES. THERE MAY BE A CHANCE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN THE EVENING.  AS WE HEAD INTO THE WEEKEND, THE WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNSETTLED WITH A MIX OF SUN, CLOUDS, AND SCATTERED SHOWERS THROUGHOUT BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES ARE FORECASTED TO BE IN THE MID70S DURING THE DAY AND DROP DOWN TO THE LOW 60S IN THE EVENINGS.  OVERALL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE CAN EXPECT A TYPICAL SUMMER WEATHER PATTERN WITH WARM TEMPERATURES, OCCASIONAL SHOWERS, AND SOME THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. ITS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO STAY UPDATED ON THE WEATHER FORECAST AND BE PREPARED FOR ANY CHANGES THAT MAY OCCUR. STAY SAFE AND ENJOY THE OUTDOORS
